# Programming Assignment for Design & Analysis of Algorithms (CSC-310)


## Recommendations

Though I have ways that you can execute the program without using the `.sh` files, it is highly recommened to use them as they will be updated with the best possible plans for execution.


## Generation of Data

If you wish to generate the data, please run the `./run_generator.sh` in the terminal. Or build the project and execute the project with `./project generate`

## Testing the Data

To run the tests, make sure you first have data (if no data exists the program will error). Execute `./run_tests.sh` in the terminal to run the tests or build the project using the Makefile located in the build directory and run the `./project` file that gets generated.

After running the tests, all of the results will be organized into a CSV file located in the output folder.
